- Tremwil (for the arxan code restoration disabler, vtable-rs and a few other boilerplate-y things as well as implementing the initial FD4 singleton finder for TGA that I appropriated).
- Dasaav (for [libER](https://github.com/Dasaav-dsv/libER) and heaps of engine-related structures).
- Sfix (for coming up with the FD4 singleton finder approach at all).
- Yui (for some structures as well as AOBs and hinting at some logic existing in the binary).
- Vawser (and probably many more) (for hosting the param defs used with the param struct generator).
